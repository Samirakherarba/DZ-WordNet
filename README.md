# DZ-WordNet
 This project aims to create the first lexical resource for the Algerian dialect to solve NLP tasks for this dialect. This WordNet involves many words in Algerian Darija along with their transliterations, synonyms, antonyms, definitions, semantic relations and conjugation of verbs.
We translated the gathered word definitions from the Larousse dictionary from French to Algerian Darija by fine-tuning the T5 model on our parallel data. We had French-Algerian Darija words and sentences from the basic DZ WordNet.
